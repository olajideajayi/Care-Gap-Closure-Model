# Care-Gap-Closure-Model
Gaps in care refers to the difference between the care provided to patients and the recommended best practices in healthcare. Gaps in care can manifest in several ways:Â A patient in an at-risk age group fails to comply with recommended screenings or preventative care for example, mammogram, colonoscopy, or misses a vaccine. 

And it is not just important for the patients. It affects the bottom line of providers and payors too. An 8% conversion rate across two gaps in care has the potential to deliver over $10MM in incremental revenue.
